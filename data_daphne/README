The velocity fields in this folder are from experiments.
Formated data is on Tornado/pcloud: /local_raid/dgsl1/3_Daphne_StAndrews/TransportLagrangien/FSLE/Dispersion_papier
The experiments are labeled in Table 4.1 of he PhD manuscript:
- Experiment A = 201118_Hetero30b
- Experiment B = 201118_Hetero18b
- Experiment N = 191030_regimeII
- Experiment O = 191030_regimeI

The velocity fields grid size is 100*100.
The time step between each velocity field is dt=0.05 second
Each .dat file contains 1000 time steps (corresponding to 50 seconds, i.e. 62.5 rotation periods)
There are 6 .dat files for Experiment A because in total 6000 iterations have been recorded.

Velocity, position and time have dimensions of m/s, m and s.
Radius: R=0.49 m
Rotation rate: Omega = 7.8540 s^{-1}
Coriolis parameter: f=2*Omega=2*7.8540 s^{-1}

A rotation time is T=2*pi/Omega = 0.8 second

# RUN PROGRAM
# --------------

In a terminal:
gfortran streamt.f90   #will produce the executable a.out
./a.out  #will execute a.out

The trajectories are written in fort.1001 (2 columns, X and Y, for every particle, repeated nt times)
